 49; headed
 family firm
 
 Andrew David Steiner, 49, of Am-
 bler, president of NHP Corp. for the
 last 20 years, was killed in a traffic
 accident while driving to work
 Wednesday morning.
 
 T lost a best friend and adviser,
 and I dont know how I could replace
 him, said Robert I. Toll, chairman of
 the board and CEO of Toll Bros. Inc.,
 where Mr. Steiner was a board mem-
 ber.
 
 A 1963 graduate of St. John's Col-
 lege in Annapolis, Md., Mr. Steiner
 graduated from the University of
 Pennsylvania School of Law in 1966.
 
 While he enjoyed the law as an
 intellectual activity, friends said, he
 did not like practicing it, and he took
 over Natural Health Products Corp., a
 business that had been started by his
 father. NHP Corp. manufactures vita-
 mins and owns and operates a chain
 of vitamin stores. Mr. Steiner also
 owned a cookware store in Haverford.
 
 But Mr. Steiner impressed and
 sometimes amazed his friends as a
 complex intellectual whose curiosity
 recognized few boundaries.
 
 After finishing his law studies, he
 took courses in philosophy at Temple
 University and according to friends
 had a taste in reading that included
 everything from ancient languages
 to the latest junk novel.
 
 He was admired for his business
 sense as well. For 21 years, Mr.
 Steiner served on the board of direc-
 tors of Advanta, a financial services
 company that operates a credit card
 business, handles second mortgages
 
 Andrew David Steiner
 
 and owns Colonial National Bank in
 Wilmington.
 
 He was also named the first outside
 director of Toll Bros, when the con-
 struction company went public five
 years ago.
 
 He played tennis and enjoyed fish-
 ing from his bass boat with his friends
 and his son. Only recently, according
 to Toll, he had found that the fishing
 in the Schuylkill was fabulous. It was
 his secret, Toll said,
 
 And he loved to play cards.
 
 He was so affable, Toll said. I
 dont know anybody who met him
 who didn't like him. But he was quiet;
 he wasnt extroverted.... There was
 laughter and joy about him. He could
 laugh in the tensest of situations.
 
 He was the president of the St.
 Johns College Alumni Association.
 
 He is survived by his wife, Lenore
 Henly Steiner; daughter, Rebecca;
 son, Andrew D. Jr.; parents, Ray-
 mond and Marion, and a sister.
