 T. Roland Berner, feisty
 Curtiss-Wright chairman
 
 gressiv
 legend on Wall Street.
 
 A lawyer by training, Mr.
 Berner launched his career as a
 
 tiss-Wright, then a diversified
 aerospace giant. He lost the proxy
 fight but won enough votes to be
 invited to join the Curtiss-Wright
 
 peere Seamey Wrane & Gene te
 
 trol.
 
 Many of his battles were con-
 tentious. In 1973, Curtiss-Wright
 wanted to buy 25 percent control
 of Airco Inc. of Montvale, an in-
 dustrial-gas manufacturer. In-
 stead, Airco merged with BOC In-
 ternational Ltd. of Great Britain
 to eliminate Berners threat.
 
 His flair for public drama
 peaked in 1978, when Curtiss-
 Wright bought a 10 percent stake
 in what was then known as Kenne-
 cott Copper Corp., a New York-
 based mining company in a slump.
 He charged that Kennecott was
 
 tempting i
 Wright; they fought to a truce in
 which the companies swapped
 stock holdings.
 
 Mr. Berner served a brief and
 stormy tenure as president and
 chief executive officer of troubled
 Western Union in 1984, after wag-
 ing a similar proxy battle for con-
 trol of that company. 
 
 Funeral arrangements were in-
 complete Tuesday night.

 T. ROLAND BERNER, chairman
 and president of the Curtiss-Wright
 Corp. for the past three decades, who
 lived in FORT LEE, died Sunday of
 a heart attack while visiting relatives
 in Boston. He was 80.
 
 In 1948 and more than a decade
 before he took over what then was a
 leading maker of aircraft engines,
 Berner led a group of dissident
 stockholders seeking to oust the
 companys management.
 
 As head of the diversified aero-
 
 space components producer in the
 late 1970s and early 80s, Berner
 waged an unsuccessful three-year
 battle to control the Kennecott Cop-
 per Corp.
 
 The struggle ended in 1981 when
 both parties agreed that neither one
 would try to take over the other for
 the next 10 years. However, Kenne-
 cott came away with Curtiss-
 Wrights pollution-control subsid-
 iary, Dorr-Oliver Inc.
 
 Berner graduated from Harvard
 and Columbia Law School and be-
 
 gan practice in Manhattan in 1936,
 His practice was interrupted by
 World War II, for which Berner
 served as a lieutenant commander in
 charge of the Navys air operational
 training in Jacksonville, Fla.
 
 Berner is survived by sons, Edgar
 of Warren, Conn., and Thomas and
 Richard of Cold Spring, N.Y.;
 daughters, Rosalie Fedoruk of Wash-
 ington, and Dr. Winifred Parker of
 Wayland, Mass; a sister and 12
 grandchildren.
