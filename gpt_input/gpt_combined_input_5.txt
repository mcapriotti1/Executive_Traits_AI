Deramus III
 
 KANSAS CITY, Mo.  William N.
 Deramus III, chairman of Kansas
 City Southern Industries Inc., died
 Wednesday at age 73. A cause of
 death was not released.
 
 Mr. Deramus began his railroad
 career in 1939 on the Wabash Rail-
 road after receiving a law degree
 from Harvard University. In 1949,
 he became the youngest railroad
 chief when he was named president
 of the old Chicago, Great Western
 Railway.
 
 In 1961, Mr. Deramus was elected
 president of the Kansas City
 Southern Railway Co. and its subsid-
 iary, Louisiana & Arkansas Railway
 Co. Mr. Deramus succeeded his fa-
 ther.
 
 He established Kansas City
 Southern Industries as a holding
 company in the early 1960s. It was
 one of the first of its kind in the rail-
 road industry, and it expanded into
 life insurance, real estate, broad-
 casting and data processing.

 Deramus dies
 
 By C.J. FOGEL
 The Times
 
 The Shreveport business and civic
 community mourned one of the
 last old-time railroad men Thurs-
 day. William N. Deramus III, 73,
 chairman of Kansas City Southern
 Industries, Inc., was considered a
 generous contributor to the youth of
 Louisiana.
 
 It would be fair to say that he
 was one of the last great railroad
 men, said long-time associate Joe
 Webb, associate vice president of
 Kansas City Southern, KCSIs
 flagship railroad.
 
 Deramus died Wednesday in Kan-
 sas City, Mo., after suffering a heart
 attack in his office.
 
 Kansas City Southern operates
 out of the Shreveport-Bossier City
 area and employs 550 workers.
 Though he lived in Kansas City, De-
 ramus will be remembered as an
 important contributor to
 Shreveports civic community.
 
 For more than 35 years, his com-
 pany has been the largest single
 buyer at the Junior Livestock Auc-
 tion held each year at the Louisiana
 State Fair. KCS has spent about $4
 million at the auction since the early
 1950s, about half of which was spent
 in the last 10 years, according to
 Johnny Fatheree, director of live-
 stock and agriculture at the fair.
 
 T dont know of any organization
 that has spent that kind of money on
 kids in this state, Fatheree said.
 That auction represents an invest-
 ment in thousands of youngsters and
 their families... He was a great
 man and there aren't too many left.
 
 Deramus was recently named to
 the Junior Livestock Auction Hall of
 Fame.
 
 Nicknamed The Hat because he
 was rarely seen without one  even
 during board meetings  Deramus
 is remembered by associates as a
 tough businessman who did almost
 every kind of job that there is ina
 railroad before succeeding his
 father as president of KCS in 1961.
 
 Though he received his law
 
 William Deramus II}
 
 degree from Harvard Law School,
 friends and associates say Deramus
 never lost his touch with the work-
 ing man.
 
 He had the respect of all of those
 who knew him, said Webb. He
 wouldnt cut a job unless it was a
 dire need.
 
 Deramus began his career as a
 transportation apprentice on the
 Wabash Railroad in 1939. He
 worked as an assistant trainmaster
 on the Wabash and as an assistant to
 the general manager of KCS before
 becoming president of the Chicago
 Great Western railroad at the age of
 33.
 
 Railroading was his life, said
 Tom Carter, chairman of KCS and
 an associate of Deramus for 32
 years. He was a friend and advisor
 to each and every one of us.
 
 Deramus is survived by his wife,
 Patricia; a son; three daughters; and
 10 grandchildren. Memorial ser-
 vices will be held at 4 p.m. Saturday
 in Kansas City.
 
 The family requests no flowers
 and suggests instead contributions
 to the Friends of the Kansas City
 Zoo, 3515 Broadway, Kansas City,
