Dr. S. J. Sarnoff, researcher, dies

A memorial service for Dr. Stan-
ley J. Sarnoff, a renowned cardiology
research scientist and businessman,
will be held Thursday at 11 a.m. at
the Washington Hebrew Congrega-
tion, 3935 Macomb St. in Northwest
Washington.

Dr. Sarnoff, who was 73 and lived
in Bethesda, died Wednesday of
heart failure at University Hospital
in Salt Lake City.

Dr. Sarnoff was born in Brooklyn,
N.Y. He earned a bachelor’s degree
in philosophy from Princeton in
1938 and a medical degree from
Johns Hopkins University Medical
School in 1942. He then was ap-
pointed a fellow at Beth Israel Hospi-
tal in Boston, at Mount Sinai Hospi-
tal in New York and at Harvard Med-
ical School.

Early in his career, Dr. Sarnoff
began researching the physiology of
the heart. In 1951, he was appointed
associate professor of physiology at
the Harvard School of Public Health.
In 1954, he established a cardiovas-
cular physiology laboratory at the

National Heart Institute, a part of the
National Institutes of Health, in Be-
thesda.

In his 11 years as chief of the
physiology lab, Dr. Sarnoff helped
establish some of the concepts un-
derlying the present understanding
of the human heart and the circula-
tory system.

In the 1960s, Dr. Sarnoff ob-
tained a patent on an automatic in-
jector used by patients to inject a
drug painlessly by removing a safety
cap and pressing the device against
the thigh.

In 1969, he founded Survival
Technology Inc., which produced
more than 55 million “auto-injec-
tors,” that contained antidotes for
use by the U.S. military as protection
against nerve gas attacks. The com-
pany, which has facilities in Bethes-
da and St. Louis, reported $16.6 mil-
lion in sales in 1989 and has 303
employees.

Dr. Sarnoff wrote more than 200
scientific publications and invented
or helped invent more than 40 pat-

ented medical devices.

He invented an electronic trans-
mitter, which was also sold by the
company, that enabled heart pa-
tients to transmit an electrocardio-
gram over the telephone to an emer-
gency care center. The care center
could then determine whether the
patient was suffering a heart attack
and arrange for treatment.

In 1980, Dr. Sarnoff, established
the Stanley J. Sarnoff Endowment
for Cardiovascular Science Inc., to
provide fellowships to allow medical
students to take a year off from med-
ical school to do cardiology research.

Dr. Sarnoff was the recipient of
many awards and was a member of
many boards and commissions, in-
cluding the Army Science Board, a
military advisory group.

He is survived by his wife, Lili-
Charlotte Sarnoff of Bethesda; a son,
Robert L. Sarnoff of Woodstock, Vt.;
a daughter, Daniela Bargezi of Basel,
Switzerland; and two sisters, Doro-
thy Sarnoff Raymond and Elaine Lil-
ian Sarnoff, both of New York City.
