MELVIN STARR

Melvin Starr, 69, whose sign busi-
ness played a major role in lighting
up the Great White Way, died of a
heart attack yesterday at his home in
Riverdale, Bronx.

Starr’s company, Artkraft Strauss,
at 57th St. and 12th Ave., built the
famous smoke-ring-blowing Camel
cigarets sign in Times Square. It also
did a blocklong waterfall sign for
Bond Clothes that later was taken
over by Pepsi-Cola.

His father designed and construct-
ed the first Times Square New Year's
Eve ball. which ushered in 1909, and
many of the earliest electric Times
Square signs.

The son carried on that tradition
and expanded into elaborate score-
board signs for Shea Stadium and oth-
er ballparks. He exported signs to Ni-
geria, Iceland and Peru. Last year he
restored the Carnegie Hall marquee.

Starr is survived by his wife, Jean;
his daughter, Tama, and a son, Jona-
than.

The funeral service will be at 10
a.m. tomorrow at Riverside Chapel,
96th St. and Amsterdam Ave.
