chairman of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, pub-
lished more than 90 scientific pa-
pers on steroid research and re-
ceived more than 120 U.S. patents.

Among his scientific accom-
plishments was pioneering work in

developing ways to selectively flu-

orinate steroids, which led to the
synthesis of new corticoids for
treating skin diseases.

His discovery of a new synthesis
for norethindrone made possible
the large-scale manufacture of the
oral contraceptive agent.

Dr. Bowers was born in Man-
chester, England, and held a bach-

elor’s degree in chemistry from
the University of London and a
doctorate in organic chemistry
from the University of
Manchester.
