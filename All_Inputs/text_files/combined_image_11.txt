R.E. Burket,
executive with
Archer Daniels

Richard E. Burket, 63, a
longtime vice president of Archer
Daniels Midland Co., died Friday
in Decatur Memorial Hospital
after apparently suffering a heart
attack at the company’s Decatur
headquarters.

Mr. Burket, the company’s chief
spokesman, had served as vice
president and assistant to the
chairman for the last 11 years. He
joined ADM in 1969 as a corpo-
rate vice president and was
promoted to vice president and
assistant to the president in 1974.
His work included corporate re-
search and governmental rela-
tions.

As ADM’s chief spokesman,
Mr. Burket was at the forefront of
a number of agri-business issues.
Most recently, he spoke of the ad-
vantages of ethanol, a gasoline ad-
ditive made of corn. He wrote in
a June letter to the Tribune in
support of the product, of which
ADM is the country’s largest pro-
ducer.

Mr. Burket entered the agri-pro-
cessing industry in 1954 after
serving in the Army as a tank
commander during the Korean
War. He graduated from Oberlin
College in 1950.

He is survived by three
daughters, Leslie, Buffie and
Lynn; a brother; a sister; and
three grandchildren.

Memorial services were held

Monday.
