 synthesis of new corticoids for
 treating skin diseases.

 for norethindrone made possible
 the large-scale manufacture of the
 oral contraceptive agent.
 
 Dr. Bowers was born in Man-
 chester, England, and held a bach-
 
 elors degree in chemistry from
 the University of London and a
 doctorate in organic chemistry
