 DAVID W. NEWELL
 Perfect example of leadership
 
 BY JOE WALKER
 SUN STAFF WRITER
 
 Friends say the late David W.
 Newell was one of the most civic-
 minded people they ever knew,
 irreplaceable in his many roles in
 the community.
 
 The 50-year-old executive vice
 president of Citizens Bank and
 Trust Co. and president of-Growth
 Inc. died Wednesday afternoon of
 an apparent heart attack while
 wading in the ocean while on vaca-
 tion at Litchfield Beach, S.C.
 
 A resident of 120 Mimosa Lane,
 Mr. Newell was or had been
 involved with about 14 civic organi-
 said his close friend, Alan Raidt.
 
 Td mentioned not too long ago
 that he had to cut back on some of
 those things, Raidt said. He was
 
 just the friendliest, happiest guy
 you could know for someone who
 was that busy and dedicated.
 Aside from his key jobs with the
 bank and with Growth, Mr. Newell
 was on the executive committee of
 the Greater Paducah Economic
 Development Corp.; a director and
 vice chairman of Main Street Inc.;
 a director of the Paducah Art Guild
 and a member of the Paducah
 
 economic development board,
 called Mr. Newell a stalwart
 member of the civic community.
 He not only brought his financial
 savvy to the table, but he was just
 a very sound person, very easy to
 work with. He had a very positive
 attitude on life and people.
 
 Raidt, former president of the
 Downtown Development Associa-
 
 tion, said he met Mr. Newell
 through that organization and the
 Crime Stoppers board. A former
 DDA director, Mr. Newell ended
 terms this year on the boards of
 Crime Stoppers, the Paducah Sym-
 phony and Boy Scouts of America.
 
 He had that rs regan to go
 out and do something, to share his
 talents, said Growth executive
 director Dick Holland. He wasnt
 just my director, he was my
 friend.

 was very in getting the best
 and most for our dollars.
 Sen. Helen Garrett said Mr.
 Newell had taken on an increasing
 role of leadership in the community
 and we'll all miss him very much.
 It just doesnt seem ble. Id
 have to think it (heart attack) is an
 indication of the stress involved.
 He had talked to me and we
 discussed many, many for
 the betterment of Paducah. He was
 a part of progress in that area,
 almost everything that was
 on.
 e-Executive Gary Hovekamp
 said knew and admired Mr.
 Newell long before enews judge,
 
 going
 
 Mr. Newell not only contributed
 money to the arts, he got involved,
 im often at
 the Art Guild looking at exhibits.
 He appreciated the arts and the
 Paducah Symphony. Its good to
 see a business person doing that.
 
 Raidt, a restaurateur form-
 erly ran a recording studio, said
 Mr. Newell sang and wrote country
 music and visited the studio to get
 Raidts help.
 
 Mr. Newell held the very senior
 role of overseeing commercial
 
 Citizens i
 
 field and proved
 to be a very integral person, super-
 vising various lending officers and
 
 heading loan committees. Its prob-
 
 ably as important a function in the
 bank as there is.

 Associated Press
 
 NEW YORK William S. Pa-
 ley, who cultivated a fledgling ra-
 dio network into the $3 billion-a-
 year communications conglomer-
 até CBS Inc., was remembered by
 colleagues Saturday as a brilliant
 pioneer in broadcasting.
 
 They re-
 called his pro-
 gramming ge-
 nius for both
 high art and
 mass-entertain-
 ment programs,
 as well as a
 deep commit-
 
  ment to the
 MR. PALE news.
 Anyone
 with means can collect Picassos
 and Gauguins, but it took a Bill
 Paley to collect Jack Bennys and
 Jackie Gleasons, Lucille Balls
 and Mary Tyler Moores and, at
 the same time, Ed Murrows, Eric
 Sevareids, Charles Collingwoods
 and Walter Cronkites, said Don
 Hewitt, executive producer of 60
 Minutes.
 
 Mr. Paley, 89, died Friday night
 in his Manhattan home. The
 cause of death was believed to be
 a heart attack brought on by
 pneumonia, CBS said in a state-
 ment Saturday,
 
 Mr. Paley bought a handful of
 struggling radio stations in 1929
 for $400,000 and built them into
 one of the worlds most powerful
 communications companies. For
 more than 50 years, he controlled
 the Columbia Broadcasting Sys-
 tem as president or board chair-,
 man of its radio and television
 networks and its film, publishing,
 recording and other subsidiaries.
 
 The pioneer era in the history
 of broadcasting dies with William
 Paley, said Cronkite, a former
 CBS anchorman. He understood,
 as have few others, the necessity
 of giving broadcast news a liberty
 to perform without commercial or
 political interference.
 
 Paley is survived by four chil-
 dren, two stepchildren and eight
 grandchildren.
 
 Funeral services will be private.
 A memorial service was scheduled
 Nov. 12 in New York. Ɬ
