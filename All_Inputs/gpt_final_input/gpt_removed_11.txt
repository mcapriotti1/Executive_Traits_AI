 emergency medical devices, died May 23 in Salt Lake City of heart
 failure while undergoing surgery. His automatic injector enables a
 patient to self-administer a drug. He also invented a transmitter
 enabling heart patients to send electrocardiograms by telephone to
 
 emergency centers.
 Dr. S. J. Sarnoff, researcher, dies
 
 A memorial service for Dr. Stan-
 ley J. Sarnoff, a renowned cardiology
 research scientist and businessman,
 will be held Thursday at 11 a.m. at
 the Washington Hebrew Congrega-
 tion, 3935 Macomb St. in Northwest
 Washington.
 
 Dr. Sarnoff, who was 73 and lived
 in Bethesda, died Wednesday of
 heart failure at University Hospital
 in Salt Lake City.
 
 Dr. Sarnoff was born in Brooklyn,
 N.Y. He earned a bachelors degree
 in philosophy from Princeton in
 1938 and a medical degree from
 Johns Hopkins University Medical
 School in 1942. He then was ap-
 pointed a fellow at Beth Israel Hospi-
 tal in Boston, at Mount Sinai Hospi-
 tal in New York and at Harvard Med-
 ical School.
 
 Early in his career, Dr. Sarnoff
 began researching the physiology of
 the heart. In 1951, he was appointed
 associate professor of physiology at
 the Harvard School of Public Health.
 In 1954, he established a cardiovas-
 cular physiology laboratory at the
 
 National Heart Institute, a part of the
 National Institutes of Health, in Be-
 thesda.
 
 In his 11 years as chief of the
 physiology lab, Dr. Sarnoff helped
 establish some of the concepts un-
 derlying the present understanding
 of the human heart and the circula-
 tory system.
 
 In the 1960s, Dr. Sarnoff ob-
 tained a patent on an automatic in-
 jector used by patients to inject a
 drug painlessly by removing a safety
 cap and pressing the device against
 the thigh.
 
 In 1969, he founded Survival
 Technology Inc., which produced
 more than 55 million auto-injec-
 tors, that contained antidotes for
 use by the U.S. military as protection
 against nerve gas attacks. The com-
 pany, which has facilities in Bethes-
 da and St. Louis, reported $16.6 mil-
 lion in sales in 1989 and has 303
 employees.
 
 Dr. Sarnoff wrote more than 200
 scientific publications and invented
 or helped invent more than 40 pat-
 
 ented medical devices.
 
 He invented an electronic trans-
 mitter, which was also sold by the
 company, that enabled heart pa-
 tients to transmit an electrocardio-
 gram over the telephone to an emer-
 gency care center. The care center
 could then determine whether the
 patient was suffering a heart attack
 and arrange for treatment.
 
 In 1980, Dr. Sarnoff, established
 the Stanley J. Sarnoff Endowment
 for Cardiovascular Science Inc., to
 provide fellowships to allow medical
 students to take a year off from med-
 ical school to do cardiology research.
 
 Dr. Sarnoff was the recipient of
 many awards and was a member of
 many boards and commissions, in-
 cluding the Army Science Board, a
 military advisory group.
 
 He is survived by his wife, Lili-
 Charlotte Sarnoff of Bethesda; a son,
 Robert L. Sarnoff of Woodstock, Vt.;
 a daughter, Daniela Bargezi of Basel,
 Switzerland; and two sisters, Doro-
 thy Sarnoff Raymond and Elaine Lil-
 ian Sarnoff, both of New York City. Ɬ
