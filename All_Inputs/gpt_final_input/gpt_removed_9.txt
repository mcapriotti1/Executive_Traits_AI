 By JUDY BATTISTA
 AND MARILYN GARATEIX
 Herald Staff Writers
 
 Frank E. McKinney Jr., a champion
 Olympic swimmer who helped found and
 oversee the International Swimming Hall of
 Fame in Fort Lauderdale, died Friday in a
 plane crash in Indiana.
 
 McKinney, 53, was one of six people killed
 when two small planes collided near India-
 napolis. The National Transportation Safety
 Board is investigating.
 
 He was a dynamic guy, said Bill Kent, a
 pool equipment supplier and fellow member
 of the Hall of Fames executive committee.
 He was a very bright, driven type of a guy.
 He had a hands-on approach to everything,
 not a laid-back guy at all. I thought he was
 great.
 
 McKinney helped found the Hall of Fame
 
 in the mid-1960s and chaired its board of
 directors in 1990 and 1991. He ran executive
 board meetings by phone from his office in
 Indiana when he couldn't be in South Flor-
 
 ida.
 
 McKinney began his swimming career at
 age 7. In 1955, at 16, he won the 100-meter
 backstroke in the Pan American Games in
 Mexico City. A year later, as a high school
 junior in Indianapolis, he won a bronze
 medal in the 100-meter backstroke in the
 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia.
 
 At the 1960 Olympics in Rome, McKin-
 ney won a silver medal in the same event and
 a gold medal in the 400-meter medley relay.
 He was a former world record holder in the
 200-meter backstroke and 400-meter medley
 relay.
 
 McKinney led Indiana University, where
 he was a student, to its first Big Ten champi-
 
 onship in swimming and helped make the
 university a dominant power in collegiate
 swimming competition.
 
 He graduated from Indiana in 1961 witha
 bachelor of science in economics and finance.
 A year later, he earned his masters degree in
 business administration from Indiana Uni-
 versity.
 
 McKinney spent two years stationed at the
 Pentagon in Washington, D.C., as a first lieu-
 tenant with U.S. Army intelligence.
 
 After his military stint was done, he
 worked for the First National Bank of Chi-
 cago for several years. Later he joined Ameri-
 can Fletcher National Bank, where he even-
 tually succeeded his father as chairman.
 
 McKinney helped make the bank into one
 of Indianas largest financial institutions. He
 retired from banking in 1990. A service was
 held in Indianapolis. Ɬ
