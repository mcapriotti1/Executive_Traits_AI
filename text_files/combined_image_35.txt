NEW YORK William S. Pa-
ley, who cultivated a fledgling ra-
dio network into the $3 billion-a-
year communications conglomer-
até CBS Inc., was remembered by
colleagues Saturday as a brilliant
pioneer in broadcasting.

They re-
called his pro-
gramming ge-
nius for both
high art and
mass-entertain-
ment programs,
as well as a
deep commit-

— ment to the
MR. PALE news.
‘Anyone
with means can collect Picassos
and Gauguins, but it took a Bill
Paley to collect Jack Bennys and
Jackie Gleasons, Lucille Balls
and Mary Tyler Moores and, at
the same time, Ed Murrows, Eric
Sevareids, Charles Collingwoods
and Walter Cronkites,” said Don
Hewitt, executive producer of ‘60
Minutes.”

Mr. Paley, 89, died Friday night
in his Manhattan home. The
cause of death was believed to be
a heart attack brought on by
pneumonia, CBS said in a state-
ment Saturday,

Mr. Paley bought a handful of
struggling radio stations in 1929
for $400,000 and built them into
one of the world’s most powerful
communications companies. For
more than 50 years, he controlled
the Columbia Broadcasting Sys-
tem as president or board chair-,
man of its radio and television
networks and its film, publishing,
recording and other subsidiaries.

“The pioneer era in the history
of broadcasting dies with William
Paley,” said Cronkite, a former
CBS anchorman. “He understood,
as have few others, the necessity
of giving broadcast news a liberty
to perform without commercial or
political interference.”

Paley is survived by four chil-
dren, two stepchildren and eight
grandchildren.

Funeral services will be private.
A memorial service was scheduled
Nov. 12 in New York.
