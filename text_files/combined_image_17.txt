KANSAS CITY, Mo. — William N.
Deramus III, chairman of Kansas
City Southern Industries Inc., died
Wednesday at age 73. A cause of
death was not released.

Mr. Deramus began his railroad
career in 1939 on the Wabash Rail-

from Harvard University. In 1949,
he became the youngest railroad

of the old Chicago, Great Western
Railway.

In 1961, Mr. Deramus was elected
president of the Kansas City
Southern Railway Co. and its subsid-
iary, Louisiana & Arkansas Railway

ther.

He established Kansas City
Southern Industries as a holding
company in the early 1960s. It was
one of the first of its kind in the rail-
road industry, and it expanded into
life insurance, real estate, broad-
casting and data processing.

The Shreveport business and civic
community mourned one of the
“last old-time railroad men” Thurs-
day. William N. Deramus III, 73,
chairman of Kansas City Southern
Industries, Inc., was considered a
generous contributor to the youth of
Louisiana.

“It would be fair to say that he
was one of the last great railroad
men,” said long-time associate Joe
Webb, associate vice president of
Kansas City Southern, KCSI’s
flagship railroad.

Deramus died Wednesday in Kan-
sas City, Mo., after suffering a heart
attack in his office.

Kansas City Southern operates
out of the Shreveport-Bossier City
area and employs 550 workers.
Though he lived in Kansas City, De-
ramus will be remembered as an
important contributor to
Shreveport’s civic community.

For more than 35 years, his com-
pany has been the largest single
buyer at the Junior Livestock Auc-
tion held each year at the Louisiana
State Fair. KCS has spent about $4
million at the auction since the early
1950s, about half of which was spent
in the last 10 years, according to
Johnny Fatheree, director of live-
stock and agriculture at the fair.

“T don’t know of any organization
that has spent that kind of money on
kids in this state,” Fatheree said.
“That auction represents an invest-
ment in thousands of youngsters and
their families... He was a great
man and there aren't too many left.”

Deramus was recently named to
the Junior Livestock Auction Hall of
Fame.

Nicknamed “The Hat” because he
was rarely seen without one — even
during board meetings — Deramus
is remembered by associates as a
tough businessman who did “almost
every kind of job that there is ina
railroad” before succeeding his
father as president of KCS in 1961.

Though he received his law

William Deramus II}

degree from Harvard Law School,
friends and associates say Deramus
never lost his touch with the work-
ing man.

“He had the respect of all of those
who knew him,” said Webb. ‘He
wouldn’t cut a job unless it was a
dire need.”

Deramus began his career as a
transportation apprentice on the
Wabash Railroad in 1939. He
worked as an assistant trainmaster
on the Wabash and as an assistant to
the general manager of KCS before
becoming president of the Chicago
Great Western railroad at the age of
33.

“Railroading was his life,” said
Tom Carter, chairman of KCS and
an associate of Deramus for 32
years. “He was a friend and advisor
to each and every one of us.”

Deramus is survived by his wife,
Patricia; a son; three daughters; and
10 grandchildren. Memorial ser-
vices will be held at 4 p.m. Saturday
in Kansas City.

The family requests no flowers
and suggests instead contributions
to the Friends of the Kansas City
Zoo, 3515 Broadway, Kansas City,
Mo.
