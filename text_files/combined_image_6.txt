T. Roland Berner, feisty
Curtiss-Wright chairman

gressiv
legend on Wall Street.

A lawyer by training, Mr.
Berner launched his career as a

tiss-Wright, then a diversified
aerospace giant. He lost the proxy
fight but won enough votes to be
invited to join the Curtiss-Wright

peere Seamey Wrane & Gene te

trol.

Many of his battles were con-
tentious. In 1973, Curtiss-Wright
wanted to buy 25 percent control
of Airco Inc. of Montvale, an in-
dustrial-gas manufacturer. In-
stead, Airco merged with BOC In-
ternational Ltd. of Great Britain
to eliminate Berner’s threat.

His flair for public drama
peaked in 1978, when Curtiss-
Wright bought a 10 percent stake
in what was then known as Kenne-
cott Copper Corp., a New York-
based mining company in a slump.
He charged that Kennecott was

tempting i
Wright; they fought to a truce in
which the companies swapped
stock holdings.

Mr. Berner served a brief and
stormy tenure as president and
chief executive officer of troubled
Western Union in 1984, after wag-
ing a similar proxy battle for con-
trol of that company. ’

Funeral arrangements were in-
complete Tuesday night.
T. Roland Berner, Curtiss-Wright Corp. chief

T. ROLAND BERNER, chairman
and president of the Curtiss-Wright
Corp. for the past three decades, who
lived in FORT LEE, died Sunday of
a heart attack while visiting relatives
in Boston. He was 80.

In 1948 and more than a decade
before he took over what then was a
leading ‘maker of aircraft engines,
Berner led a group of dissident
stockholders seeking to oust the
company’s management.

As head of the diversified aero-

space components producer in the
late 1970s and early 80s, Berner
waged an unsuccessful three-year
battle to control the Kennecott Cop-
per Corp.

The struggle ended in 1981 when
both parties agreed that neither one
would try to take over the other for
the next 10 years. However, Kenne-
cott came away with Curtiss-
Wright’s pollution-control subsid-
iary, Dorr-Oliver Inc.

Berner graduated from Harvard
and Columbia Law School and be-

gan practice in Manhattan in 1936,
His practice was interrupted by
World War II, for which Berner
served as a lieutenant commander in
charge of the Navy’s air operational
training in Jacksonville, Fla.

Berner is survived by sons, Edgar
of Warren, Conn., and Thomas and
Richard of Cold Spring, N.Y.;
daughters, Rosalie Fedoruk of Wash-
ington, and Dr. Winifred Parker of
Wayland, Mass; a sister and 12
grandchildren.
