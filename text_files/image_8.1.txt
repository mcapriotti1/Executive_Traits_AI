The New York Times

Dr, Albert Bowers, chairman
and former chief executive of the
Syntex Corp., died on Thursday at
the University of California’s San
Francisco Medical Center in Palo
Alto. He was 60 and lived in Palo
Alto.

A chemist by training, Dr. Bow-
ers joined the international phar-

maceutical and life sciences con-
cern in 1956 as a group leader of
research. He held several other po-
sitions at Syntex before becoming
president in 1976.

He was appointed chairman in
1981, a year after he was made
chief executive. He relinquished
the chief executive designation
last July.

He had planned to retire as

chairman on car because of
bad health.

During Dr. Bowers’ years as
head of Syntex, the company’s
sales more than doubled, to $1.349
billion in 1989, and its profits more
than tripled, to $303 million.

A number of new prescription
drugs were developed, and Syntex,
which had been through volatile

changes of fortune on the stock
market, settled down to steadier
growth.

Dr. Bowers, a former board

chairman of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, pub-
lished more than 90 scientific pa-
pers on steroid research and re-
ceived more than 120 U.S. patents.

Among his scientific accom-
plishments was pioneering work in

developing ways to selectively flu-

orinate steroids, which led to the
synthesis of new corticoids for
treating skin diseases.

His discovery of a new synthesis
for norethindrone made possible
the large-scale manufacture of the
oral contraceptive agent.

Dr. Bowers was born in Man-
chester, England, and held a bach-

elor’s degree in chemistry from
the University of London and a
doctorate in organic chemistry
from the University of
Manchester.

He did postdoctoral study at
Wayne State University in Ohio
under a Fulbright fellowship.

In 1964, Dr. Bowers was award-
ed the Mexican Academy of Sci-
ence’s annual prize.
