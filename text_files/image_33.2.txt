Friends say the late David W.
Newell was one of the most civic-
minded people they ever knew,
irreplaceable in his many roles in
the community.

The 50-year-old executive vice
president of Citizens Bank and
Trust Co. and president of-Growth
Inc. died Wednesday afternoon of
an apparent heart attack while
wading in the ocean while on vaca-
tion at Litchfield Beach, S.C.

A resident of 120 Mimosa Lane,
Mr. Newell was or had been
involved with about 14 civic organi-
said his close friend, Alan Raidt.

“T’d mentioned not too long ago
that he had to cut back on some of
those things,” Raidt said. “He was

just the friendliest, happiest guy
you could know for someone who
was that busy and dedicated.”
Aside from his key jobs with the
bank and with Growth, Mr. Newell
was on the executive committee of
the Greater Paducah Economic
Development Corp.; a director and
vice chairman of Main Street Inc.;
a director of the Paducah Art Guild
and a member of the Paducah

economic development board,
called Mr. Newell ‘‘a stalwart
member of the civic community.
He not only brought his financial
savvy to the table, but he was just
a very sound person, very easy to
work with. He had a very positive
attitude on life and people.”

Raidt, former president of the
Downtown Development Associa-

tion, said he met Mr. Newell
through that organization and the
Crime Stoppers board. A former
DDA director, Mr. Newell ended
terms this year on the boards of
Crime Stoppers, the Paducah Sym-
phony and Boy Scouts of America.

“He had that rs regan to go
out and do something, to share his
talents,’’ said Growth executive
director Dick Holland. “‘He wasn’t
just my director, he was my
friend.”’
