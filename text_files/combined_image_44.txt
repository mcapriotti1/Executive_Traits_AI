A. Steiner,

49; headed
family firm

Andrew David Steiner, 49, of Am-
bler, president of NHP Corp. for the
last 20 years, was killed in a traffic
accident while driving to work
Wednesday morning.

“T lost a best friend and adviser,
and I don’t know how I could replace
him,” said Robert I. Toll, chairman of
the board and CEO of Toll Bros. Inc.,
where Mr. Steiner was a board mem-
ber.

A 1963 graduate of St. John's Col-
lege in Annapolis, Md., Mr. Steiner
graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania School of Law in 1966.

While he enjoyed the law as an
intellectual activity, friends said, he
did not like practicing it, and he took
over Natural Health Products Corp., a
business that had been started by his
father. NHP Corp. manufactures vita-
mins and owns and operates a chain
of vitamin stores. Mr. Steiner also
owned a cookware store in Haverford.

But Mr. Steiner impressed and
sometimes amazed his friends as a
complex intellectual whose curiosity
recognized few boundaries.

After finishing his law studies, he
took courses in philosophy at Temple
University and according to friends
had a taste in reading that included
everything from ancient languages
to the latest junk novel.

He was admired for his business
sense as well. For 21 years, Mr.
Steiner served on the board of direc-
tors of Advanta, a financial services
company that operates a credit card
business, handles second mortgages

Andrew David Steiner

and owns Colonial National Bank in
Wilmington.

He was also named the first outside
director of Toll Bros, when the con-
struction company went public five
years ago.

He played tennis and enjoyed fish-
ing from his bass boat with his friends
and his son. Only recently, according
to Toll, he had found that the fishing
in the Schuylkill was fabulous. “It was
his secret,” Toll said,

And he loved to play cards.

“He was so affable,” Toll said. “I
don’t know anybody who met him
who didn't like him. But he was quiet;
he wasn’t extroverted.... There was
laughter and joy about him. He could
laugh in the tensest of situations.”

He was the president of the St.
John’s College Alumni Association.

He is survived by his wife, Lenore
Henly Steiner; daughter, Rebecca;
son, Andrew D. Jr.; parents, Ray-
mond and Marion, and a sister.

Memorial services will be at 3 p.m.
today at Joseph Levine & Son, 7112 N.
Broad St.
