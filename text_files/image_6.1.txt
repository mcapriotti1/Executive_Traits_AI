T. Roland Berner, feisty
Curtiss-Wright chairman

gressiv
legend on Wall Street.

A lawyer by training, Mr.
Berner launched his career as a

tiss-Wright, then a diversified
aerospace giant. He lost the proxy
fight but won enough votes to be
invited to join the Curtiss-Wright

peere Seamey Wrane & Gene te

trol.

Many of his battles were con-
tentious. In 1973, Curtiss-Wright
wanted to buy 25 percent control
of Airco Inc. of Montvale, an in-
dustrial-gas manufacturer. In-
stead, Airco merged with BOC In-
ternational Ltd. of Great Britain
to eliminate Berner’s threat.

His flair for public drama
peaked in 1978, when Curtiss-
Wright bought a 10 percent stake
in what was then known as Kenne-
cott Copper Corp., a New York-
based mining company in a slump.
He charged that Kennecott was

tempting i
Wright; they fought to a truce in
which the companies swapped
stock holdings.

Mr. Berner served a brief and
stormy tenure as president and
chief executive officer of troubled
Western Union in 1984, after wag-
ing a similar proxy battle for con-
trol of that company. ’

Funeral arrangements were in-
complete Tuesday night.
