University of California at San

Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.
“Joe was very interested in the
environment

“He once told me that he was
taught by his mother that they
must always give something back
to those who help them,” Doyle
added. “He not only gave financial
support, but he also gave us his
counsel. He was very much a peo-

the environment.”
