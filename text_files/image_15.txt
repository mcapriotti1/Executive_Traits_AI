Grocery executive dies in plane crash

MOBILE (AP) — A World War Il-vintage airplane, flying in loops, ap-
parently stalled in flight before it crashed and burned, killing the pilot
and his student, Alfred F. Delchamps Jr., chairman and chief executive
officer of the Delchamps grocery chain.

“Fred's untimely death is a tragic loss to the company and the com-
munity. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family,” Delchamps
President Randy Delchamps said Monday.

Funeral services were planned for Tuesday.

Also killed in the crash Sunday was 65-year-old Mark Reynolds, who
was teaching Delchamps to fly the airplane when it plunged into the
woods of north Mobile County and burned.

Reynolds flew fighter planes during World War II and had performed
in more than 60 air shows.
