 founder Hach dies at 70
 
 By JEFFREY BRUNER
 Register Stan writer
 
 Clifford Hach, 70, a noted Iowa inventor and founder of an Ames chemical
 company, died Thursday after spending the week tinkering in his laboratory,
 trying to come up with a better way to do something.
 
 Mr. Hach was respected worldwide as an authority on water analysis and
 soil testing. He was a prolific inventor in analytical chemistry, and his inven-
 tions and analytical procedures found wide acceptance among agricultural
 chemists and those working in the field of water analysis.
 
 Mr. Hach and his wife, Kathryn, founded the Hach Co, in Ames in 1948. In
 1977, they moved the companys headquarters to Loveland, Colo., where he
 died of a heart attack. The company still has a distribution center in Ames.
 
 Robert Hansen, a chemistry professor at lowa State University, said Mr.
 Hach was a hard-working man,
 
 He drove himself very hard, especially when his company was starting,
 Hansen said, He couldn't imagine anyone who went only 40 hours a week.
 
 Indeed, Mr. Hach once said, The most persistent problem of my life has
 been chronic impatience.
 
 He was responsible for many inventions, including the turbidimeter, which
 measures the clarity of liquids, and automated analyzers for controlling water
 treatment.
 
 Mr. Hach was born in Clutier and was reared on a farm near Green Moun-
 tain, He graduated from Iowa State University with a degree in chemistry.
 
 Hansen said Mr. Hach founded the chemical company with Harvey Diehl, a
 retired ISU chemistry professor. Dieh! later sold his share of the company
 after their friendship soured, Hansen said.
 
 Diehl declined to talk about his relationship with Mr. Hach.
 
 Mr. Hach is survived by his wife; two sons, Bruce Hach and Paul Hach; a
 daughter, Mary Gibbs; and eight grandchildren, all of Loveland.
 
 Memoria! contributions may be made to the Hach Scientific Foundation,
 which provides college scholarships for chemistry students. Ɬ

 eins fighting spirit bred life
 
 from Barron Hilton. His blue and gave Klein the ultimate sports vic-
 
 1984 after
 Like a lightning bolt
 Klein stormed racing
 
 Eugene V. Klein, who died yesterday in Califor-
 nia at the age of 69, will be remembered as the
 dominant thoroughbred owner of the 1980s, even
 though he came to the game and left it in a
 veritable flash, much like the gold lightning bolt
 that slashed across his blue racing silks.
 
 At the time he put his all-star stable up for
 auction last Nov, 6 at Keeneland, Klein had only
 been in the game for around six years, a pittance
 compared with the lifelong devotion of such estab-
 lishment owners as Ogden Phipps, Paul Mellon and
 the late John Galbreath.
 
 é a ht V
 ly brief span, Klein won i i
 jritually eeenaniy Klein won virtually
 and race worth win.  aVery trophy and
 ning, including the 1988 race worth
 
 Kentucky Derby with winning, including
 the powerful gray filly
 
 Winning Colors. Anoth- the 1988 Kentucky
 er of his fillies, Lady's Derby.
 
 Secret, was the 1986. .
 
 Horse of the Year.
 
 He and his trainer,
 
 D. Wayne Lukas, annually turned the $10 million
 Breeders Cup programs into their personal show-
 cases,
 
 Of the first 42 races, each of which carries a
 purse of at least $1 million, Klein's horses won
 seven, a record.
 
 So enormous was his success  he won Eclipse
 Awards as the nations leading owner in 1985, 1986
 and 1987  that everybody in the business was
 shocked last June when Klein announced he was
 getting out of the business. The reason, he said,
 was so he could smell the roses.
 
 Ready to relax
 
 This was a very personal decision, Klein said
 last fall. I've worked pretty hard in my life, and
 I've never had a sustained period of time off. Now I
 want to travel, to enjoy my wife, my children, my
 grandchildren, my friends.
 
 A smile twitching under his walrus-style mus-
 tache, Klein insisted that he might someday want
 to return to the game, the proof of which was that
 he planned to keep Rancho del Rayo, the 250-acre
 training center outside San Diego that's surrounded
 by a real-estate development.
 
 In retrospect, perhaps Klein knew something
 about his health that he didnt want to disclose
 publicly. Last November, as he watched his fine
 horses being sold, one after the other, he masked
 his emotions better than his wife, Joyce, who sat on
 the edge of her chair, snapping photographs that
 she framed through teary eyes.
 
 A native New Yorker, Klein was a self-made
 man who began his career by selling encyclopedias
 to work his way through New York University. He
 interrupted his education to enroll in the US. Army
 Air Corps.
 
 Moving to California after the war, Klein began
 selling used cars. He moved from that to introduc-
 ing the Volvo to the United States, after which he
 became chief executive officer of a failing theater
 and television chain, which he renamed the Nation-
 al General Corporation.
 
 By the time he sold his interest in the mid-
 1970s, National General had become a conglomer-
 ate with assets of more than $1 billion. That
 enabled him to turn his full attention to the San
 Diego Chargers football team, his toy/business
 since the early 1960s.
 
 Under Klein's ownership, the Chargers never
 made it to the Super Bowl, but they did become one
 of the National Football League's more successful
 teams behind Coach Don Coryell. Klein later used
 their insignia and colors in his racing silks.
 
 In 1984, Klein sold the Chargers for a reported
 $40 million, partly because of a heart attack he
 suffered earlier in the year, but mostly because he
 was fed up with the players and their problems. In
 horse racing, he found a new sporting interest that
 was less frustrating and more rewarding.
 
 Once he plunged into racing, the smartest thing
 he did  and Klein was always the first to admit it
  was to hook up with Lukas, who was then just
 beginning to redefine the training business. Togeth-
 er, they became the most formidable team in the
 game.
 
 Smooth sailing from the start
 
 Klein never really had to struggle, as even the
 wealthiest owners have to do at various points in
 their careers, and so he never seemed to fully
 appreciate how fortunate he was.
 
 He seemed to think the game was easy, and
 that rankled those who felt he hadn't paid his dues.
 
 The low point of Klein's career came after the
 1988 Preakness, when he ri veteran trainer
 Woody Stephens and jockey Pat Day for the tactics
 they used against Winning Colors with Forty
 Niner, the fine Claiborne Farm colt.
 
 Determined not to let Winning Colors have the
 lead unchallenged, as she had in the Derby, Day
 and Forty Niner made her run every step in the
 early eee Tee Bets Ole ees
 that ii bumping even took place on the back
 stretch.
 
 At the end, Winning Colors finished third and
 Forty Niner up the track in a race won by Risen
 Star, but Klein said his fillys chances were compro-
 mised by Forty Niner. Although Stephens and Day
 denied being guilty of anything more than trying to
 win the race, Daily Racing Form took Klein's
 side in a rare front-page editorial.
 
 As it turned out, that was Klein's last hurrah.
 The firestorm eventually flickered out, even if the
 hard feelings smoldered beneath the surface.
 
 By last November, however, Klein seemed at
 peace with himself. Sad as he was to see his
 wonderful horses being sold, he also was excited
 about the future  a future, as it turned out, that
 was all too brief. Ɬ
